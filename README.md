<h2>A camera website using SASS.</h2>

<p>This project is created using HTML and SASS. I created this following the tutorial of Dev Ed. This was the first that I used SASS. I've changed the images, color scheme, added an icon, changed the color of the video, and values of measure. This project was the fun to build and to use svg images as this was the first time that I used svg images. Beginner friendly project.</p>
